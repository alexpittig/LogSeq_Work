		- CHAP 1: Wood As A Renewable Resource
			- Maintaining healthy and resilient forests involves having product and market options for all materials
			- Timber sales and other removals of forest products support agency strategic objectives to foster resilient, adaptive ecosystems to mitigate wildfire risk and climate change, produce carbon-storing sustainable materials, and strengthen communities
			- Forest and woodlands make up over one-third of the U.S. landscape and contain 1 trillion cubic feet (28.3 billion m3) of wood volume
			- Tree cutting and removal occurs on less than 2% of forest land per year
			- Wildfire, insects, and disease are among the biggest threats to forests and woodlands in the nation. Low harvest rates, aging forests, mortality from insect and disease infestations, and extreme weather events have combined to create conditions that facilitate wildfire
			-
			- Forest industry in the U.S. makes up 17% of global roundwood production, and the Nation has the highest intensity of industrial roundwood consumption per capita. The impact of the 2007 recession on wood product demand is still reflected in inventory data, with a 19% decline in Southern timber removals between 2006 and2016.• Bioenergy is an increasingly important industrial forest product. Wood energy accounts for 20% of all renewable energy and 41% of all domestic bioenergy in 2016. Most of the wood energy that was used was manufactured by the wood products industry. In fact, the United States accounts for 26% of total wood pellet production worldwide.• Wood-processing facilities generated 4 million tons of mill residue in 2016, 99% of which was used for either fuel or fiber products such as pulp and paper.• Tree removals for products, fire management, and land-use changes on National Forests are very low and consume only 0.2% of standing volume on average, annually.• Despite the low volume of wood extracted from national forests, average annual net growth (calculated as gross growth minus mortality) declined while average annual mortality nearly doubled from 2006 to 2016. These patterns reflect aging forests and combinations of wildfire, drought, and insect infestations
