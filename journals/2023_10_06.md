		- Experimental timber HP shell - 1963 - Stuttgart
		- we **still** use timber as formwork for concrete
		- wood has an ability to shrink and swell - resulting from the arrangement of cellulose fibres -- Dylan Wood example of leveraging this to provide form + structure
- Paper Session I:
	- Lawson Spencer – Unlog Tower
		- ![Unlog_Tower__9_.jpg](../assets/Unlog_Tower_9_1696580771945_0.jpg){:height 538, :width 796}
		- his paper found here: ![10.1515_9783111162683-003.pdf](../assets/10.1515_9783111162683-003_1696580815506_0.pdf)
	- Dylan Wood: HYGROSHELL – In Situ Self-Shaping of Curved Timber Shells
- Paper Session II:
	- Moritz Niebler – Bent-on-Site Flat-Pack Delivery of a Timber Shell --> [design2production](https://www.designtoproduction.com/en/)
	- Romain Mesnil - Design and Fabrication of a Pseudo - Geodesic Gridshell
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1696587493915_0.png)
	- Eike Schling - Asymptotic Geodesic Hybrid Timber Gridshell
		- ![Untitled.jpg](../assets/Untitled_1696587804458_0.jpg)
		- Centre Pompidou -- Metz
		- beautiful mechanism for shaping the grid shell -- when you push the two groups of lamellas naturally follow this negative curvature
		- asymptotic curves are the stiffest (is it true??) -- more a bending structure than a shell structure, the bracing is very important with these structures and carrying all of the membrane loads
	- Paper Session V:
		- Seiichi Suzuki: BamX: Rethinking Deployability in Architecture Through Weaving
