- **Lecture 10 - Tensor Factorization**
	- also known as: multi-linear algebra
	- mathematical technique used in machine learning
	- it involves
		- decomposing a tensor (a multi-dimensional array) into a set of actors or components that can be multiplied together to approximate the original tensor
		- it is analogous to matrix factorization, but extends to high dimensions beyond just rows and columns
	- key concepts
		- Tensor
			- a generalization of matrices to high dimensions
			- for instance, a 3D tensor can be thought of as a cube of data, with each dimension representing a difference aspect of the data
		- Rank of a Tensor
			- similar to the rank of a matrix, it is a measure of the complexity or the amount of information in the tensor
