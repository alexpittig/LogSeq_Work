	- What is the research question?
	- My research
	- Xiliu's research
	- Questions:
		- *Is there an intervention by the human?* --> the human can react to the robot bending too far? robot reacts to the human bending too far?
		- *What happens if there is too much flexure read by the sensor?*

	- species --> monoculture ??
		- varies by region, country
		- most forestry in european areas have been heavily managed for a long time -- no natural forest left
		- Canada -- forest regions (Boreal, etc)
			- it is naturally, monoculture -- it is a black spruce forest
			- **they try to emulate natural disturbances when they harvest:**
				- they try to emulate what mother nature would do in their harvesting practices
				- requirement of the tree species
					- for example, species that need partial sun -- if you did a partial harvest and left partial sun species behind, they would then die because they get too much sun due to the forested area
			- clear cutting -- a forest fire would produce this
			- Ontario -- 91% owned by the crown -- you are legally required to regenerate that forest
				- You can't switch from a black spruce forest to something else
				- Great Lakes Forest
					- lots of natural variety here
					- disturbances here include:
						- wind events, ice storms
						- therefore they do partial harvesting to emulate nature here
			- forest unit:
				- how they define different forest types -- its in the forestry plan she wrote
				- ie. 70% red pine = red pine forest unit
			- public persection problem
				- every region is different
				- used to be called logging! Now it's **forestry**
				- They used to just log / cut things without caring, now they manage for wildlife, old growth,
				- 16" oak not existing
					- one of the objectives is to get old growth forest to a natural level
						- there's models that go backwards and tell us how much percentage of the forest should be old growth
					- second growth = it has been cut before
			- This all started in 1994 -- crown forest sustainability act -- changed from timber management to forest management and that's when other objectives came in
				- **you can find all of these online
				- look at the Ottawa Valley Guide that Lacey wrote
			- If she was to advise on a species
				- they have a lot of sawmills
				- you can't just take the good trees out, you have to also take the bad trees in order to manage the forest properly
				- poplar -- fastest growing -- used to be used for making paper but pulp and paper really doesn't matter anymore / isn't necessary to the
				- spruce, pine, fir -- mass timber
				- BUT if there was a way to widen what species could be used, like poplar, red maple, white birch (all of the soft hardwoods)
				- generally spruce, pine, fir is canada's forest -- there's lots of that around
				- smaller stems, newer growth!! THIS WOULD BE MORE SUSINTABLE IF THERE WAS DEMAND FOR IT
				- Lots of wildlife depends on young forest to survive -- to eat, forage, build shelter amongst the young growth
					- whipper will! LOOK THIS UP
						- they need both -- noctural bird, forage for insect at night, therefore they need space (ie. near a clear cut) for their nest along the edge.. they need the deep forest to make their nest (for safety) but the open area to eat because there's more bugs there
					- In an under-managed forest, it's young forests that limiting
					- the most susceptible forest to a forest fire are the ones that are past their prime, young and managed forest are actually the most resilient against fire -- they are young and green! dead wood
				- buildings are the longest life cycle for a wood product and therefore you want wood to go there
				-
				-
				- NEW GROWTH
					- poplar, red maple, white birch -- all vigorous regrowers
					- **within 6 months, the regenerating poplar is like 5.5ft tall!!**
					- they typically have to cut these species or kill them so that "better" species can survive
					- in her region they primarily plant spruce, pine, (and very rarely oak)
					- tolerant hardwood -- hard hard wood (ie. cherry, sugar maple, walnut, etc., highest value)
						- you only cut 1/3
						- really good at growing back naturally
						- they grow in extremely shady conditions
						- trees should be all different ages if it's properly managed -- you'll see a carpet of young trees, middle aged, and then older trees
						- they go out with spray paint -- orange to be harvest, blue so it stays for wildlife purposes!
							- to keep the best trees for next time
				- Invasive species
					- dutch elm disease used to be the only invasive pest
					- emarald ashborror, killing all the ash
					- beech bark disease, black bear depends on beech nuts to make it through the winter
					- white pin blistera
					- NOTHING ATTACKS POPLAR -- INVESTIGATE WHY PEOPLE DON'T WANT POPLAR
				- BARK
					- trees leave the forest intact
					- some machine do cut-to-length
