	- What is the research question?
	- My research
	- Xiliu's research
	- Questions:
		- *Is there an intervention by the human?* --> the human can react to the robot bending too far? robot reacts to the human bending too far?
		- *What happens if there is too much flexure read by the sensor?*

	- species --> monoculture ??
		- varies by region, country
		- most forestry in european areas have been heavily managed for a long time -- no natural forest left
		- Canada -- forest regions (Boreal, etc)
			- it is naturally, monoculture -- it is a black spruce forest
			- they try to emulate what mother nature would do in their harvesting practices
			- requirement of the tree species
				- for example, species that need partial sun -- if you did a partial harvest and left partial sun species behind, they would then die because they get too much sun due to the forested area
			- clear cutting -- a forest fire would produce this
			- Ontario -- 91% owned by the crown -- you are legally required to regenerate that forest
				- You can't switch from a black spruce forest to something else
				- Great Lakes Forest
					- lots of natural variety here
					- disturbances here includes
						- wind events, ice storms
						- therefore they do partial harvesting to emulate nature here
