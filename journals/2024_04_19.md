	- #### Content:
		- Active Bending in Physics-Based Mixed Reality addresses the difficulties of designing with a **non-standard** and **structurally dynamic material**, such as bamboo
		- Mixed reality (MR) as a virtual and collaborative design environment with integrated material physics simulations. This research describes the development of a workflow that integrates a reconfigurable modular bamboo system leveraging the active 
		  bending property of bamboo, a custom physics-based MR environment facilitating on-site collaborative design, and an MR user interface enabling users to customize material parameters unique to bamboo.
		- The reconfigurable modular bamboo system is a kit of parts consisting of linear, triangular, and tetrahedral bundled bamboo modules that can be assembled on the ground and lofted into complex active bending structures. Through a Physics-Based Mixed Reality design framework, multiple users can reconfigure these modules virtually, dynamically, and collaboratively, iterating through several configurations on-site before deploying real-world resources.
		- The result is a custom MR environment that enables non-expert users to participate in the design process through a user interface for managing module properties and connectivity.

		- taking a long term perspective on forests:
			- inventories in an area and mapping out which conservation values, for example how many old trees, deadwood, or broadleaf trees there are
			- example: thinning out spruce to allow more space for broadleaf trees or carrying out a nature conservation burning (a planned forest fire in a defined area) to create more opportunities for plants and animals
