	- #### Content:
		- taking a long term perspective on forests:
			- inventories in an area and mapping out which conservation values, for example how many old trees, deadwood, or broadleaf trees there are
			- example: thinning out spruce to allow more space for broadleaf trees or carrying out a nature conservation burning (a planned forest fire in a defined area) to create more opportunities for plants and animals
