		- **Shell**:
			- A shell is a three dimensional structure that resists applied loads through its inherent shape
		- **Gridshell**:
			- If regular holes are made in the shell, with the removed material concentrated into the remaining strips, the resulting structure is known as a gridshell
			- Three dimensional structural stability is maintained through in plane shear strength and stiffness, provided by preventing rotation at the intersections of the grid members (nodes), or by introducing bracing
		- **Use / Relevance of Timber:**
			- The development of a doubly curved gridshell from a flat, square or rectangular grid is made possible by the **low torsional stiffness of timber**
		- **Construction:**
			- The lattice can be initially laid out as a flat mat and then pushed into shape
			- During formation the timber lattice must allow rotation at the nodes and bending and twisting of its constituent laths. Once formed, shell action is accomplished by diagonal bracing, providing in-plane shear strength and stiffness
		- **Double-Layer Gridshell:**
			- gives cross-sectional depth, permitting strength and stability for long spans, while still permitting bending of the flat lattices to a tight radii of curvature
			- upon formation, shear blocks are installed between the parallel layers to transfer horizontal shear, thereby having the system act together with the properties of a deeper section
