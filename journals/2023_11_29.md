	- #### Content:
		- dowel diameter and spacing have significant influence on the max load capacity and stiffness of the DLT
		- predicted failure behaviour includes dowel bending, dowel-timber embedment, and tensile fracture of the bottom tensile laminate
		- their model allows an **optimised** dowel arrangement to be manufactured

	- #### Content:
		- methodology for numeric computation of the deformation and stresses in timber multi-layer structures
		- developed for layered beams and extended to curved members for use in analysis and design of timber ribbed shells
		- appendix -- describes plane and curved structural components and systems consisting of several timber layers
		- Zollinger timber shells - amoung the first at the beginning of the 20th century
		- fabrication of timber ribbed shells
			- **Method 1**
				- pre-fabricated forms are laid flat on the construction site
				- all timber planks are piled flat and joined loosely by a dowel at the cross-point of the ribs
				- form shape is maintained using temporary supports
				- whole structure is lifted in the finished position using a **fixed pillar crane**
				- once in its final positions, all layers of the tibs are joined by screws or nails and the dowels are tightened

			- **Method 2**
				- falsework (aks soffit scaffolding) taking the form of the shell is constructed
				- different positions of the ribs are labeled on the falsework, where planks are first laid and fixed temporarily
				- filler blocks are fixed on the first plank layer at the cross-points by dowels
				- before falsework is removed, the covering boards are joined by nails or dowels on the ribs

	- #### Content:
		- "In 2016, about 122 million m3 and 128 million m3 of sawn wood were produced in Europe and North America, respectively (UNECE, 2017)"
		- "Wood has high speciﬁc stiffness and strength and is an economical alternative to other commonly used building materials (Da Silva and Kyriakides, 2007)"
		- "Engineered wood products (EWPs) are increasingly being developed and optimised for structural applications leading to their signiﬁcant consumption globally"
		- "The advantages of EWPs include enhanced dimensional stability, the formation of larger and more complex structural sections, reduced effect of natural defects (e.g. knots), greater durability and more homogenous mechanical properties (Ramage et al., 2017; Asif, 2009)"
		- **Nice section on the pitfalls of adhesives** - carcinogenic, reduced reusability, environmental impact, gas emitting, etc.
		- dowel welding..?
		- DLT --> "modern design of this technology was developed in the 1970s and involved the use of nail fasteners (Henderson et al., 2012)"
