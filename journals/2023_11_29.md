	- #### Content:
		- dowel diameter and spacing have significant influence on the max load capacity and stiffness of the DLT
		- predicted failure behaviour includes dowel bending, dowel-timber embedment, and tensile fracture of the bottom tensile laminate
		- their model allows an **optimised** dowel arrangement to be manufactured

	- #### Content:
		- methodology for numeric computation of the deformation and stresses in timber multi-layer structures
		- developed for layered beams and extended to curved members for use in analysis and design of timber ribbed shells
		- appendix -- describes plane and curved structural components and systems consisting of several timber layers
		- Zollinger timber shells - amoung the first at the beginning of the 20th century
		- fabrication of timber ribbed shells
			- **Method 1**
				- pre-fabricated forms are laid flat on the construction site
				- all timber planks are piled flat and joined loosely by a dowel at the cross-point of the ribs
				- form shape is maintained using temporary supports
				- whole structure is lifted in the finished position using a **fixed pillar crane**
				- once in its final positions, all layers of the tibs are joined by screws or nails and the dowels are tightened

			- **Method 2**
				- falsework (aks soffit scaffolding) taking the form of the shell is constructed
				- different positions of the ribs are labeled on the falsework, where planks are first laid and fixed temporarily
				- filler blocks are fixed on the first plank layer at the cross-points by dowels
				- before falsework is removed, the covering boards are joined by nails or dowels on the ribs
