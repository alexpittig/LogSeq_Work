- Meeting with Paul Mayencourt
	- the link with forestry is great
	- questions the need for active bending specifically -- is there a motivation for this beyond just a structural-complex system?
	- impact of the research:
		- do I want to be an expert in these types of systems in the future? Ie. an expert in these types of shells
		- look at the carbon impact!
	- Hooke Park workshop / build
