- Meeting with Paul Mayencourt
	- the link with forestry is great
	- questions the need for active bending specifically -- is there a motivation for this beyond just a structural-complex system?
	- impact of the research:
		- my own future --> do I want to be an expert in these types of systems in the future? Ie. an expert in these types of shells
		- look at the carbon impact, ground the research in a sustainability impact
		- HIGH SCIENCE VS. APPLIED / PRATICAL (?) What do I want?? --> INDUSTRY PARTNER (!!) such as [Blumer Lehmann](https://www.blumer-lehmann.com/)
		- pushing the knowledge of how these systems are designed and engineered OR variating material properties and focusing on high resolution problems with material etc.
		- applied research --> could be active bending FOR efficient formworks
			- ie. ETH thin sections (DFAB)
			- ie. Berkley 3D printing active bending
	- general advice:
		- use your PhD to train yourself, think about the career you want after and what skills you can build now to get there! GREAT ADVICE
		- internships could be a nice way to stay practical ([Summun Engineering](https://www.summum.engineering/)in Netherlands)
		- take advantage of [Doc Mobility](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/doctoral-studies-structure/customized-curricula/epfl-doc-mobility/) and [SNSF funding opportunities](https://www.epfl.ch/campus/services/finance/services-of-the-vice-presidency-of-financ/fund-management/the-swiss-national-science-foundation/)
		- partner / create connection with IBOIS
		- look at Lea Boulic's research: [Hybrid Bending Active Systems](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/iass/piass/2018/00002018/00000028/art00003)
		- [IBUKU Bali](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiHgo6t9c-BAxUB76QKHTifAjgQFnoECBUQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fibuku.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw3lE2cfR3oa5Mey2gwGGoi5&opi=89978449) is quite cool!
	- his focus:
		- low-tech solutions
		- easily deployed
		- ie. nail / dowel laminated timber,[this Vancouver company is doing it](https://mercermasstimber.com/)
	- Will Hawkins - active bend formwork
		- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309749990_Flexible_formwork_technologies_A_state_of_the_art_review
	- Hooke Park workshop / build
	- some good links
