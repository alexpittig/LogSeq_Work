- Meeting with Paul Mayencourt
	- the link with forestry is great
	- questions the need for active bending specifically -- is there a motivation for this beyond just a structural-complex system?
	- impact of the research:
		- my own future --> do I want to be an expert in these types of systems in the future? Ie. an expert in these types of shells
		- look at the carbon impact, ground the research in a sustainability impact
		- HIGH SCIENCE VS. APPLIED / PRATICAL (?) What do I want?? --> INDUSTRY PARTNER (!!)
		- pushing the knowledge of how these systems are designed and engineered OR variating material properties and focusing on high resolution problems with material etc.
		- applied research --> could be active bending FOR efficient formworks
			- ie. ETH thin sections (DFAB)
			- ie. Berkley 3D printing active bending
	- general advice:
		- use your PhD to train yourself, think about the career you want after and what skills you can build now to get there! GREAT ADVICE
		- internships could be a nice way to stay practical ([Summun Engineering](https://www.summum.engineering/)in Netherlands)
	- his focus:
		- low-tech solutions
		- easily deployed
		- ie. nail / dowel laminated timber,[this Vancouver company is doing it](https://mercermasstimber.com/)
	- Will Hawkins - active bend formwork

	- Hooke Park workshop / build
	- some good links
