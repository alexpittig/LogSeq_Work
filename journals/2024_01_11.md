	- *What is machine learning?*
		- Ex. mathematical model that gives the probability that a photo represents a face, where 0 is not a face and 1 is a face
		- aims at designing algorithms to infer the world regularities from a finite set of examples
		- in practice, given a set of training examples *D*, build automatically a predictor *f** of a hidden value given the visible signal
		- performance should be good on test data which are not available to chose the predictor
