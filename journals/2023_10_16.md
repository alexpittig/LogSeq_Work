	- #### Content:
		- Notable Papers:
			- **The Finite Element Method (FEM) of the Unlog Tower** - *Lawson Spencer, Matthew T. Reiter, Leslie Lok, Sasa Zivkovic*
				- investigates how far this discarded material can be stretch through robotic kerfing and elastic kinematics
					- through creating bending-active components that can easily be deployed and disassembled
				- uses EAB-infested white ash, to simulate and assemble roundwood timbers into bending-active structural components for a fully permitted outdoor installation
				- utilizes what they call the **Unlog Method** -- separate paper on this
